## Run Storybook Dev Server

# Notes to Remember

- The UI Library is a separate project that can be found under the libs folder, and then navigating to the hypercare-ui folder. The storybook stories are also available there.
- The main application for the hypercare project can be found under apps/hypercare-public
- Some types like "user", has also been put into a separate lib with the intention for sharing types with the backend, or if the apps decide to go on a microfrontend system
- The CSS utilizes tailwindCSS
